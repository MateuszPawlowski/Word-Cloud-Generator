Requirements
jsoup for URLs
JavaSE-1.8 or higer

Functions And Running
Program has 3 functions: 1 to enter a file, 2 to enter a url, 3 to exit the program.
Once the user picks either 1 or 2 he is allowed to enter the specific file/url.
This creates a word cloud of random generated words from the file/link.
There is a special ignorewords.txt file which blocks a certain amount of words and they do
not end up in the final image.
The image is .png and creates a wordcloud, with random fonts, colours, and stylings.


This was a very enjoyable time. Professional approach of the boss, calm and collective knowing the locations very well. I recommend this company anytime.
